# PyBer Challenge

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create various visualizations for PyBer. PyBer is a python based ride sharing company. Using pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and matplotlib, the analysis provides results that will help improve PyBer's access to services and determine affordability in urban, suburban, and rural cities. The analysis also displays any disparities among the city types. 


## Results

### DataFrame

PyBer's CEO needed information about the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. The analysis displaying this information is grouped by each city type. The DataFrame is displayed below:

### Visualizations

The total fare by city type is displayed in a multiple-line chart. As shown in the legend, the blue line is rural, the red line is suburban and the yellow line is urban. The graph is displayed below:

Pie charts for total rides, total drivers, and total fares can be seen below:

## Summary

From the summary DataFrame and the Total Fare by City Type chart, many recommendations can be made. 

Rides in urban areas have been found to have the overall highest fares as well as the highest total rides. Urban cities do however have the lowest average fare per ride. I would recommend that PyBer increase prices in urban areas since there is a large demand and the company will be able to receive even more profits. 

Additionally, the data shows that rides in suburban and rural cities contribute to less than half of the total rides. Suburban and rural rides have higher average fares per rides. It is possible that the ride fares are too high for people to afford in these types of cities, so I would recommend that the price be lowered in suburban and rural areas.

The data shows that the average fare per driver is highest in rural areas. The number of drivers in rural areas is also lowest compared to suburban and urban cities. With a low supply of drivers, it comes as no surprise that the average fare for each driver would be higher due to supply and demand. I would recommend that PyBer markets job opportunities to drivers in rural areas to bring down the cost of drivers in these areas.
